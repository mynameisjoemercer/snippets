				I want to make it such that one of these options is clicked 
				and then we do an action based on what was clicked: <br><br>
				So when one of these buttons is clicked, it will send a 
				request to a server with some information (probably the literal text that was clicked). Then the server will take 
				this information and based on what it is will return some
				information. This returned information will be a list of 
				"search results" along with information about what the 
				"right" answer is. <br><br>
				To do this I need a server. <br><br>
				Or can I just run the entire thing within the browser. 
				I think I can. But the browser needs to be able to listen 
				and respond.
